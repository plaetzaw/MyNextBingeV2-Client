Known issues:

On a full movie/tvshow page- directing to another title doesn't happen correctly, the id is put into the URL but the component doesn't re-render.

I want to resize the primary posters on the full info card, have to mess with the API config.

Need to add placeholder posters for cards, instead of just the minicards.

Need to make titles/characters flow to a second or third line instead of just making the card expand super wide.

Need to add streaming placeholders still.

404 Page not working on an invalid URL
